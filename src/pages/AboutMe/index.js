                        <p class="text-left text-xl"> I decided to pursue a career in software development (having graduated with a First Class Honours in Chemical Engineering) after I tried my hand at using Python while training my own StyleGAN to artificially generate artwork. As someone who loves to paint, I value creativity and attention-to-detail in everything I do, and Software engineering is the perfect creative outlet that values and leverages these skills, but also the analytical, interpersonal, technical and problem-solving skills I have honed during my time as an engineer. In the future I aspire to work with the latest tech, helping to innovate and create high-quality and revolutionary apps, projects, products and services. Aside from programming and painting, I love to dance, hit the gym, complete obstacle courses, and manage my investment portfolio.
                            <br></br><br></br>
                            Currently, I am training with futureproof to upskill as a Full Stack Developer in order to kick-start my career in Software Engineering. Iâ€™m excited to be transitioning from coding as a hobby to becoming a valuable part of a team that builds innovative software products to meet user needs.
